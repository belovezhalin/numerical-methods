# Numerical Methods

This repository provides C++ implementations of various **numerical methods** including root finding, linear system solving, interpolation, and more. These methods are essential for computational mathematics.

## Features:
- Geometric Sequence Solver
- Root Finding Methods
- Newton's Method
- Scaled Gauss Elimination
- Finite Difference Methods (FAD)
- Successive Over Relaxation (SOR)
- Interpolation Techniques
- Spline Functions

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/belovezhalin/numerical-methods.git
    ```
2. Compile and run:
3. ```bash
    cd numerical-methods
    g++ -o numerical_methods main.cpp
    ./numerical_methods
    ```
