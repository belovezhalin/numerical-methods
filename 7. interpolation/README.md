# Task Description
The task involves computing the value of the Hermite interpolating polynomial and its coefficients.

## Solution Submission
You need to submit a single file to the BaCa system containing the complete solution along with the `main` function.

## Calculation Accuracy
The results generated by your program should match the reference solution. The acceptable deviations are set as follows:
- Absolute tolerance: \(10^{-14}\)
- Relative tolerance: \(10^{-10}\)

A result with an error smaller than the maximum allowable will also be accepted. It is recommended to compute results with the highest possible accuracy.

## Input Description
The input will have the following format:
```
M N
X1 X2 ... XM
Y1 Y2 ... YM
T1 T2 ... TN
```
where:
- `M` - A natural number in the range \([1,100]\)
- `N` - A natural number in the range \([1,100000]\)
- `Xi` - Interpolation nodes. Assume this is a sequence of `double` numbers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `Yi` - Values or derivative values at interpolation points (details below).
- `Ti` - Points where the interpolating polynomial's value needs to be computed.

### Example 1
For the following input:
```
3 1
1.0 2.0 3.0
5.0 4.0 6.0
7.0
```
We seek an interpolating polynomial `f` that satisfies:
```
f(1) = 5
f(2) = 4
f(3) = 6
```

### Example 2
If interpolation nodes are repeated, it means we are dealing with Hermite interpolation. The subsequent `Yi` values correspond to derivative values at the repeated interpolation node. For the following input:
```
6 1
1.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 3.0
4.0 2.0 6.0 1.0 7.0 9.0
7.0
```
We seek an interpolating polynomial `f` that satisfies:
```
f(1)   = 4
f'(1)  = 2
f''(1) = 6
f(2)   = 1
f'(2)  = 7
f(3)   = 9
```
If a node is repeated `k` times, the corresponding numbers in the `Yi` sequence represent the function value at that node and its derivatives up to order `k-1`.

## Output Description
Results should be printed with a precision of 17 significant digits. The output should consist of numbers:
```
W1 W2 ... WM
F1 F2 ... FN
```
where:
- `Wi` - Coefficients of the Newton basis interpolating polynomial: `1, (x-X1), (x-X1)*(x-X2), (x-X1)*(x-X2)*(x-X3), ...`
- `Fi` - The value of the interpolating polynomial computed at point `Ti`.
